Coursera CodeSkulptor small programs I've made while going through 
[An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2/home/welcome).
If there's a link at the top of the file, you'll need to open that link in a browser or paste the code at [py2.codeskulptor.org](https://py2.codeskulptor.org). Why Python2? That's what they use in class, don't worry about it. lol.


The following files in the repo can be run at [py2.codeskulptor.org](https://py2.codeskulptor.org)
and the result is in a cute little gif ❤️
